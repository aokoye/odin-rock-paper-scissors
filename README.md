# The Oden Project: Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Part 1 - playing in the console
This took longer than I expected and involved looking up a lot of things in order to get it to loop 5 times. The majority of the project was very straight forward, but the current iteration of The Odin Project makes the very last step (getting it to loop 5 times) difficult.

## Part 2 - using the DOM
This was pretty challenging. I ended up watching Ania Kub√≥w's [Three ways to code Rock Paper Scissors](https://youtu.be/RwFeg0cEZvQ) video to help with part of it.
